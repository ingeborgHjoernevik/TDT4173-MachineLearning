To run the code open the notebook in online with google colab. Furthermore you must download the CIFAR-10 dataset. 
This is a public dataset that can easily be retrived from: 
https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html 
Then you must upload the dataset in a google drive and make sure that the directory fits the file structure of your google drive. After that run the cells in the notebook from top to bottom.
Please note that some of the cells have long runtime and they can be interrupted to check other cells of interrest. This is especially with regards to the exploration of the hyperparameters of the random forest classifier and the optimization part using the optuna library.
